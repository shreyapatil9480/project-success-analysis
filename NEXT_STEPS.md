# Next Steps and Future Work

This project provides a starting point for analyzing factors that influence project success. Possible next steps include:

- **Feature engineering:** Create derived features (e.g., budget per team member, complexity-duration ratio) to capture more nuanced relationships.
- **Model tuning:** Implement hyperparameter optimization (e.g., grid search or randomized search) to improve predictive performance.
- **Additional models:** Experiment with other algorithms such as gradient boosting, support vector machines, or neural networks.
- **Validation and testing:** Use cross-validation and hold-out test sets to better estimate generalization performance.
- **Real-world data:** Replace the synthetic dataset with an actual project dataset from open sources or your organization for a more realistic analysis.
